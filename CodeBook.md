###                          DATA DICTIONARY
###                       HUMAN ACTIVITY RECOGNITION

## This data set is the average of features that represent mean or standard deviation
## in the original data set for human activity recognition  using smart phones datasets
## for every combination of activity name & subject ID

The original data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
 

Note: The activity was represented as factors from 1-6 in the original data set.
The factors have been replaced by the descriptive activity labels
